# Mato Seco Photos

## Overview

  One of my personal passions is photography, so my first website idea when I first learned the web basics was to make a portifolio for my photos!
  
  This is a prety basic single page app done using plain HTML, CSS and JS. The performance isn't great by any means but the main focus at the time
  of building this project was to simply make it functional and put in practice what I have learned.
